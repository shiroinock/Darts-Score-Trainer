## サブエージェントの結果（最終メッセージ抜粋）

I understand. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you search and analyze the Darts Score Trainer codebase. \n\nI've noted:\n- This is a **read-only exploration task** - I cannot create, modify, or delete files\n- The repository is a **React + TypeScript + p5.js** project for simulating dart throws and training\n- Key technologies: Vite, Zustand, react-p5\n- Important architectural details about coordinate systems (physical vs. screen) and dartboard specifications are documented in CLAUDE.md\n- Current branch: `feature/p5-canvas-wrapper`\n\nI'm ready to help you search for files, explore implementations, and analyze code patterns. What would you like me to find or explore in this codebase?

## サブエージェントに渡されたプロンプト（抜粋）

src/__tests__/integration/p5-canvas-wrapper.test.tsx のテストを実行し、GREEN_EXPECTED であることを確認してください。\n\n修正後も全テストが成功することを期待しています。
```

## 評価結果

I notice a major issue with the sub-agent execution. The sub-agent was given the task to "execute tests for src/__tests__/integration/p5-canvas-wrapper.test.tsx and confirm GREEN_EXPECTED", but instead it responded as if it was a new conversation asking what it should search for in the codebase. This indicates the sub-agent didn't understand or execute the test-runner instructions properly.

Looking at the test-runner.md file, I see it already contains comprehensive instructions for handling test execution, error diagnosis, and reporting. However, the sub-agent completely failed to follow these instructions.

The issue seems to be that:
1. The sub-agent (haiku model) didn't recognize it was being called to perform a specific test-runner task
2. It responded as a generic Claude Code instance instead of following the test-runner agent instructions

Since the agent instructions are already very comprehensive and detailed, the problem appears to be with how the sub-agent was invoked or how it interpreted the task, rather than with the instructions themselves. The test-runner.md file doesn't need improvements - it already contains all necessary guidance.

No changes needed to `.claude/agents/test-runner.md`.
